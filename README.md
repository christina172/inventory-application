Inventory Application (The Odin Project, JavaScript Path, Node.js Course, Express and Mongoose)

This Inventory Application is created with the help of Express Application Generator. The app uses a MongoDB database. It is populated with some sample data (by running populatedb.js). The app includes forms to add, update and delete documents and uses PUG view engine to create views for pages displaying category and item lists, details, forms and the home page.

This Inventory app has categories and items, so when the user goes to the home-page they can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category. They can also view the list of all items, detail pages for each category and item. Users can add new categories and items, update and delete them.
